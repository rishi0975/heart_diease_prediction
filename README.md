# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
Preventing heart disease has become a critical priority in today's world. Data-driven systems for predicting heart disease can significantly enhance research and prevention efforts, ensuring more individuals lead healthier lives. This project leverages Machine Learning to predict the presence of heart disease, providing accurate and reliable predictions.

## Project Description
The project involves the following key steps:
1. **Dataset Analysis**: Analyzed a heart disease patient dataset, exploring trends and correlations.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed the data for optimal model performance.
3. **Model Training**: Applied and compared various Machine Learning algorithms, including:
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Logistic Regression
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluated models to identify the best-performing algorithm for the binary classification problem.

The target variable in this project predicts whether a patient has heart disease (`1`) or not (`0`), based on various health-related input features.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Keras
- **Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook

## Key Features
